      <h2>What does EventGo provide?</h2>
      <p>EventGo gives hosts the ability to stream their event for their online guests, as well as allows for loved ones to send the
        hosts hopeful, and loving messages or take pictures, either of the event or the guests, that can be saved later by the 
        host, after the event. Guests are also able to save the pictures that they take during the event.</p>

    <div class="dark info">
      <h2>How does EventGo work?</h2>
      <p>When the hosts creates the "event", they create a personal link to invite loved ones. After the event is finished, the hosts 
        are given the opportunity to save messages and photos sent by the guests. After the event has ended and the mementos are saved
        by the hosts and guests,the system clears everything. Make sure you save everything before finishing!
